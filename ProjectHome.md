BGE Launcher is a simple Unity3D like Game launcher! The blender game engine lacks a proper game launcher! That is the reason why I created the BGE Launcher.

The BGE Launcher is written in pyqt4.

Executables for the launcher will follow soon. There for I use cxfreeze. Cxfreeze bundles all necessary files into one executable. The executable than can also be run on platforms where python is not installed.
